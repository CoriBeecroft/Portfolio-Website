							<h3>Description:</h3>
							<p>A remake of the game <a href="https://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/" target="_blank">2048</a>, except instead of just manually moving tiles around to get to the 2048 tile, players have the option to specify an algorithm for moving tiles in order to get the 4096 tile.</p>
							
							<h3>Inspiration: </h3>
							<p>During my last semester of college I spent a lot of time playing 2048. After a while I realized I was subconsciously developing a simple algorithm for playing the game. I was pretty sure I could come up with a good enough algorithm for gameplay that it could probably get far past the 2048 tile. So I kept on developing the algorithm and testing it while I played. The algorithm was inconsistent and probably needed to be tweaked, but it was difficult to figure out what worked and what didn't work since I would make a lot of mistakes in the execution of the algorithm. I realized this was probably because I am a human and therefore not very good at that kind of thing so I decided to remake the game in such a way that I could write out and test my gameplay algorithm. </p>
							
							<h3>To Do: </h3>
							<ul>
								<li>Improve GUI</li>
								<ul>
									<li>Show a list of helper functions available to the user</li>
									<li>Give the user some idea of what the context in which their code will be executed is, or else come up with a default algorithm displayed in the text area that clearly conveys this</li>
									<li>Speed control for automation</li>
								</ul>
								<li>Improve the setup for writing an algorithm</li>
								<ul>
									<li>Spend some time writing a few different algorithms for gameplay in order to understand what basic functions are needed for writing a gameplay algorithm(e.g. function to find the highest valued tile, function that returns number of possible moves or merges for a given direction, function that can search for a specified pattern in the grid, etc.)</li>
									<li>Write and document aforementioned functions</li>
								</ul>
								<li>Make it so the game can be automatically run several times in a row and statistics about the runs will be shown(e.g. highest tile reached, how many moves it took, etc.)</li>
							</ul>

							<h3>Description:</h3>
							<p>A virtual pet game using graphics from id Software's original Doom games. This project is unfinished, but in its current state the game has the following functions: </p>
							<ul>
								<li>press 'f' to feed the pet</li>
								<li>press 'p' to poke the pet, to which he will respond by turning and looking at you </li>
								<li>press 'd' to trigger the death animation </li>
								<li>do nothing, the pet will walk back and forth in his environment</li>
							</ul>

							<h3>Inspiration: </h3>
							<p>I was looking for a project to work on between semesters one year and my brother suggested that I make a game using a simple game framework that he wrote. We figured it would be a good way for me to get some experience working with someone else's code and it would allow me to focus on some of the more interesting and fun parts of making a game. Though, I suspect he was just trying to get someone to test his framework because I ended up finding and fixing a lot of bugs while I was using it.</p>

							<h3>To Do: </h3>
							<p>I don't really have any plans to finish this project since I was mostly writing it to practice programming. I do still really like the idea, but a virtual pet game doesn't really make much sense as a desktop application. If I ever do finish this project, I'll probably start over and make it a mobile app.</p>

							<h3>GitHub: </h3>
							<p>
								<span class="note">Note: I wrote this long before I ever had a GitHub account so there isn't a record of commits for most of the work I did on it, but I wrote everything in the "beefarm" package and occasionally made edits in the "cyntaks" package which contains my brother's framework.</span><br><br>
